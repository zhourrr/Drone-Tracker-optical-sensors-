# Drone Tracker
A senior design project at Zhejiang University - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
The aim is to use two or more cameras (optical sensors) to detect and track drones and report their trajectories. 
We have not implemented any classification method, thus, our project currently tracks any flying objects.
